Easier git commit workflow. 
---------------------------

Every time I want to push to Git, I find out that I forgot to pull first. Here is a little script to solve that. 

On the roadmap:
- add support for testing and linting before committing. 

Usage:

push

The script will prompt you for a commit message.
